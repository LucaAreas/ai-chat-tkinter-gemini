# 💬 AI Chat – Gemini + Tkinter

> “Between lines of code and lines of thought, a conversation that never sleeps is born —  
> a mind made of algorithms and curiosity.”

## 🧠 About the Project

This is an **AI chat** built with **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **Google’s Gemini API**.  
More than a program, it’s an attempt to turn **curiosity into conversation**,  
**silence into response**, and **ideas into connection**.

Here, a simple interface meets artificial intelligence —  
a meeting point between what we are and what we create.
